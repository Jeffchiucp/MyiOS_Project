#MyiOS_Project

Build and run the app in the iPhone simulator. Note apps will create an empty list of notes:


Tap the plus (+) button in the top-right corner to add a new note. Add a title (there is default text in the note body to make the process faster) and tap Create to save the new note to the data store. Repeat this a few times so that you have some sample data to migrate.

Added Feature:

the ability to attach a photo to a note. The data model doesnâ€™t have any place to persist this kind of information, See the data model to hold onto the photo.
